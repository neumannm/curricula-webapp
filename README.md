# Curricula Webapp

Grails web app for CRUD operations on a curricula database.

This app has been developed as part of my research at TH KÃ¶ln - University of Applied Sciences.

## Running

This repository contains a [template file](grails-app/conf/application.yml.template) with placeholders for security-critical information like database url and user credentials.
Create a copy of this file in the same folder, named `application.yml`, and change the respective configuration parameters.

Fire up grails in interactive mode:

`$ grails`

Then, in grails:

`grails> compile`

`grails> run-app`

Stop app with

`grails> stop-app`

## Development

The development of this app was based on this [tutorial](https://www.djamware.com/post/585b41f580aca73b19a2efd5/easy-creating-simple-crud-web-application-using-grails-3).
